# The 10 Best Context Engineering Open Source Projects in 2025

> "Context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step." --Andrej Karpathy

In 2025, context engineering is no longer a monolith. It has rapidly matured into several distinct branches:
- Memory Architectures: Tools that give AI systems long-term memory and persistence across sessions.
- Retrieval & Routing: Context selection systems that pull relevant information dynamically from large corpora.
- MCP Servers & Protocols: Standardized infrastructure enabling agent-to-context communication (e.g., Model Context Protocol).
- Workflow Composition: Frameworks that orchestrate multi-turn logic, tools, and memory in complex agent systems.
- Agent Platforms: End-to-end systems for deploying and managing AI agents with rich context capabilities.

This article highlights 10 of the most impactful open-source projects leading the way in each category — shaping how AI agents remember, retrieve, reason, and respond.

## 1. LangChain

**Owner:** langchain-ai
**Stars:** 111k | **Forks:** 18.1k
**GitHub:** [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)

LangChain remains the most influential context engineering framework. It helps developers build context-aware chains of LLM calls with modular tools for memory, retrieval, agent workflows, and integration. Its memory modules like `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` and robust RAG pipelines make it a cornerstone of any context-aware app.

## 3. LlamaIndex

**Owner:** run-llama
**Stars:** 42.9k | **Forks:** 6.2k
**GitHub:** [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)

LlamaIndex is a leading data framework for building LLM apps with custom context. It offers powerful document loaders, indexing techniques, and retrieval strategies to structure and access the right data efficiently.

## 4. LangGraph

**Owner:** langchain-ai
**Stars:** 15.4k | **Forks:** 2.7k
**GitHub:** [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)

Built by the LangChain team, LangGraph introduces graph-based agent workflows with persistent state and inter-agent memory. It's ideal for orchestrating multi-agent conversations with scoped and evolving context.

## 5. Letta

**Owner:** letta-ai
**Stars:** 17.2k | **Forks:** 1.8k
**GitHub:** [Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta)

Letta brings fine-grained control to agent planning and task memory. It's optimized for complex multi-turn conversations where agents need both short-term and long-term memory, and integrates well with voice and assistant platforms.

## 6. MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)

**Owner:** GitHub (by Anthropic)
**Stars:** 17.1k | **Forks:** 1.3k
**GitHub:** [github-mcp-server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how AI agents consume context from external systems. The GitHub MCP server is the reference implementation for building context-aware LLM tools, offering event-driven context injection.
