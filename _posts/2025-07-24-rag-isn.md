# RAG Isn’t Enough. Context Engineering is how real AI gets built

While most of the world still fine-tunes prompts and tweaks RAG pipelines, the bleeding edge is focused on building **context-aware systems** with memory, adaptability, and purpose.

Karpathy said it best:
> “Prompt engineering is writing a sentence. Context engineering is writing the screenplay.”

LangChain’s Harrison Chase echoed:
> “Most AI agent failures aren’t model failures—they’re context failures.”

## Why RAG Isn’t Enough

- Long context ≠ good context
- Irrelevant data = hallucinations
- Flat document retrieval = no memory, no reasoning

IEEE and arXiv research confirms it:
RAG systems plateau without **context awareness**, **long-term memory**, and **semantic reasoning**.

## Context Space: The Ultimate Context Engineering Infrastructure

We built **Context Space** to solve exactly this.

> A unified framework for context-native AI, starting from **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **integrations**.

As AI leaders like Andrej Karpathy recognize, context engineering is "the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step." Context Space transforms this principle into production-ready infrastructure.

### What we deliver today:

- 14+ Service Integrations: GitHub, Slack, Airtable, HubSpot, and more

- Secure OAuth Flows: Much better than editing MCP config files manually

- Enterprise Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring, and observability

- Context Engineering Foundation: Built with the future of AI agent development in mind

### What we're building:

- MCP Protocol Support: Native AI agent integration

- Context Memory: Persistent, intelligent context across sessions

- Smart Context Selection: Semantic retrieval and optimization

- Context Analytics: Deep insights into context usage and effectiveness

## Get Started Now

Build context-aware workflows from scratch—using our open, extendable framework.

Context Space provides robust third-party service integrations today, with advanced context engineering features on our roadmap. See Current Capabilities vs Roadmap for details.

## The Context Engineering Revolution Has Begun

OpenManus, ClearCoreAI, Mayo Clinic, JPMorgan, and Amazon have all proved the same thing:

Context is no longer optional. It’s **infrastructure**.

The winners won’t be those who prompt better—they’ll be those who engineer **context at scale**.
